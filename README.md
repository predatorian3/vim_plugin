# VimPlugin

The `vim_plugin` application will allow the user to create a Vim Pathogen 
Plugin directory structure for vim plugin authoring.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vim_plugin', git: 'https://github.com/predatorian3/vim_plugin'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rake install:local
```

## Usage

Simply fire up a terminal and exceute the `vim-plugin` command, and 
let [Thor](http://whatisthor.com) do its magic.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run 
`rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an 
interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To 
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run 
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push 
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
